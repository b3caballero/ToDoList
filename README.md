# ToDoList

This is partly a project for developing my own skills and partly to solve a real world issue I'm facing at work. A lot of requests come from email messages sent by users and I'd like a way to automatically take those emails and add them to a list. Of course this is secondary to the primary function of having a list of items that need to be completed along with priority numbers and other nice to have features. 

Currently in the process of building/re-learing Java. Once we have something more professional this document should be updated.
